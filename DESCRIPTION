Description: Interpolation of term structures of interest rates that
    takes into account the meetings where the regulators discuss
    the changes on interest rates.
    In Brazil these meetins are called COPOM and this interpolation considers
    that the interest rate between COPOM meetings are flat, instead of being
    flat betweet bonds maturities.
    This is relevant for the short term of the term structure where
    the interpolation is used to price private bonds and interest rate
    derivatives.
